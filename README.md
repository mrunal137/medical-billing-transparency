# medical-billing-transparency
This project is a Data Analytics solution aimed at bringing transparency to hospital billing across India. It explores variations in healthcare costs across hospitals, cities and procedures - enabling stakeholders to understand cost distributions and identify anomalies. Tools Used - Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scipy, Sklearn), Power BI, VS Code

🔍 Key Features:
📊 Interactive Dashboard built using Power BI
📁 Custom simulated dataset of 120 hospital billing records
🧪 Hypothesis testing using Python (t-test, ANOVA, correlation)
📈 Linear Regression Model to predict final hospital bill
🔍 EDA: Summary stats, city-wise analysis, correlations, and cost trends

🧾 Dataset Fields:
Hospital Name
City, State
Procedure
Cost, Room Charge, Lab Fee
Insurance Discount
Final Bill
